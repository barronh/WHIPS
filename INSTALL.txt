INSTALL.txt

This file provides instructions on how to install the whips
program on your local *nix machine.  There are currently no plans to
support a Windows installation.

PREREQUISITES
=============

WHIPS depends on the following 3rd party pieces of software

1) python (version 2.5.x or newer, but NOT version 3)

   The software used here was all written for python version 2.5.x. or later
   Though there is a version 3 of python, it is not backwards
   compatible and should not be used.

   Python may already be installed on your system.  Try executing

   	  which python

   to see if this is the case.  If you have it, try

      	  python -V

   and if the version number is greater than 2.5 you can skip this step.

   If you do have to install python, or simply want a fresh copy, then
   do the following:

   1.1: Obtain the source code from the official python website
      http://python.org/download/releases/

   1.2: Untar the source
   	  
	  tar -xzvf python-2.x.y.tar.gz

   1.3: Set any desired compilation environmental variables.  These
      include all variables commonly recognized by autoconf scripts,
      including:
	  
	CC for the C compiler
	CFLAGS for the C compiler flags
	CXX for the C++ compiler
	CXXFLAGS for the C++ compiler flags
	and many others

      If you have no idea what any of this means don't worry about it,
      it's more than likely safe to ignore it.

   1.4: Change to the unpacked directory and run the configuration
      script.  The script accepts numerous arguments, the most
      important among them the --prefix argument that sets the base
      directory for the install.

      	  cd python-2.x.y
	  ./configure --prefix=/path/to/base/directory

   1.5: Make the program and install it to the base directory

   	  make install

   1.6: Confirm that your default python is now the one you just
      installed.  Run the following commands to regenerate the list of
      commands as if you'd just logged in, then look at the full path
      to the default copy of python.

          rehash
	  which python
 
      This should print out

          /path/to/base/directory/bin/python

      If it does not, you need to adjust your path in your shrc file
      (~/.tcshrc, ~/.cshrc, ~/.bashrc, depending on your shell) to
      point to the new copy of python.  Do NOT attempt to use an alias
      to point to the correct copy of python as this can cause serious
      errors with python's installation tools.
      
2) Install HDF4

   The software was orignally written with HDF 4.2.6.  It should be
   backwards compatible beyond that but no attempts have been made to
   determine how far back it goes.

   HDF4 software is necessary to read in the MOPITT data.

   The following instructions detail how to install from source.
   You're welcome to try to install the binaries available.

   2.1: Download the HDF4 source code from
      http://wwww.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF/HDF_Current/src/

   2.2: Untar the source code

   	  tar -xzvf hdf-4.2.6.tar.gz

   2.3: Install JPEG.  The HDF4 installation depends on the JPEG
      libraries, so we'll need to install those before we can proceed
      with installing HDF4.

      2.3.1: Download the JPEG (v66 or newer) source code.  A link is
         provided at http://www.hdfgroup.org/release4/obtain.html

      2.3.2: Untar JPEG

      	     tar -xzvf jpegsrc.v66.tar.gz

      2.3.3: Move to the untarred jpeg directory and run the configure
         script.  Again, make sure to set the --prefix flag to the
         base directory of the install

	     cd jpeg-6b
	     ./configure --prefix=/path/to/base/directory

      2.3.4: Build the libraries

      	     make

      2.3.5: Install the libraries to the base directory.  Note that
         unlike most well-behaved distributions, this actually has a
         chance of failing.  If it complains about a file called
         'cjpeg.1', try explicitly creating the filetree in which it
         resides, then re-running the install.  Note that we have to
	 run two separate commands to actually get the libraries.

	      make install
	      make install-lib

   2.4: Install zlib.  The HDF4 installation depends on this library
      as well.  We build it from source, though binaries may work
      better for your system.

      2.4.1: Obtain zlib.  Note that though it is linked from the HDF4
         site, the link was broken as of the last time I checked.  The
         source code can be obtained directly from http://zlib.net

      2.4.2: Untar the zlib source distribution
     
	     tar -xzvf zlib-1.2.6.tar.gz

      2.4.3: Change to folder and configure the zlib install.  As
         always, set the base directory using the --prefix flag

	     cd zlib-1.2.6
	     ./configure --prefix=/path/to/base/directory

      2.4.4: Test the installation if desired

      	     make test

      2.4.5: If the tests pass, install the libraries to the base
         directory.

	     make install

   2.5: Set some environmental variables that will be needed during
      the install.  Note that the F77 variable might not be necessary, but
      CFLAGS does need to include the -fPIC flag

      	     setenv F77 gfortran
	     setenv CFLAGS -fPIC 

      On 64-bit versions of OSX (and possibly other operating systems),
      the compilers may get confused.  If this is the case, it can be
      rectified by adjusting the above to the following:

      	     setenv F77 gfortran
	     setenv CFLAGS "-fPIC -m64"
	     setenv FFLAGS -m64

   2.6: Configure HDF for installation.  Note that unlike most
      configurations, this step requires more than just the --prefix
      flag.  Make sure to give the correct path the base directory
      under which the zlib and jpeg installs (not the source code!)
      live.  The --disable-netcdf is also critical, but may prevent
      you from using this HDF build for other purposes.

      	     cd hdf-4.2.6
             ./configure --with-zlib=/path/to/base/directory \
	     		 --with-jpeg=/path/to/base/directory \
			 --disable-netcdf \
			 --prefix=/path/to/base/directory

   2.7: Build the HDF4 libraries

   	     make

   2.8: Test the installation

   	     make test

   2.9: Install to the base directory

   	     make install

3) Install HDF5

   This is a completely separate install from HDF4.  You have to
   install BOTH even though they are both HDF.  Provides read
   functionality for HDF-EOS files used by OMI instruments, as well as
   supporting the netCDF installation (step 4)

   As per usual, it is probably possible to acquire binaries, but the
   instructions below are for compilation from source.

   3.1: Acquire the HDF5 source code from
      http://wwww.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/current/src

   3.2: Untar the source code.

   	     tar -xzvf hdf5-1.8.8.tar.gz

   3.3: Set an environment variable to point the configuration script
      to the desired FORTRAN compilers.  The program has a really
      buggy compiler autodetect "feature" that makes this necessary.

      	    setenv FC gfortran

   3.4: Configure, noting that this is again a case where the flags
      passed to the configure script are mandatory.  Make sure that
      the --with-zlib flag points to a valid directory that contains
      the zlib library and another with the include files.  You 
      should already have installed zlib under step 2.4 above.

      	    cd hdf5-1.8.8
      	    ./configure --prefix=/path/to/base/directory \
	    		--enable-fortran \
			--with-zlib=/path/to/base/directory/lib,/path/to/base/directory/include \

   3.5: Build HDF5

       	   make

   3.6: Test the build

       	   make check

   3.7: Install the build

       	   make install

4) Install netCDF

   netCDF is necessary to write out to the commonly used netCDF file
   format.  The software has only been tested with a netcdf-4.1.3
   installation.  Earlier versions of netCDF-4 might work, and 
   there's even a chance netCDF-3 would work, but you're best off
   with the latest verison.

   4.1: Download the source from
      http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/index.jsp

   4.2: Decompress the source code

   	   untar -xzvf netcdf-4.1.3.tar.gz

   4.3: Set environmental variables that will tell netCDF where the 
      HDF5 installation lives.  We need to include both of these so
      it can find the libraries and the include files

      	   setenv LDFLAGS -L/path/to/base/directory/lib
	   setenv CPPFLAGS -I/path/to/base/directory/include

   4.4: Configure the installation using the prefix flag to specify
      the base directory for the install.

           cd netcdf-4.1.3
	   ./configure --disable-fortran --prefix=/path/to/base/directory

   4.5: Build the program
   	   
	   make

   4.6: Test the build

   	   make check

   4.7: If the test ran successfully, install.  

           make install

5) Install the geos framework

   The geos framework (short for geometry engine - open source) is a
   library containing many common GIS functions.  We need it to build
   shapely, the python module that we use to perform the geometry
   operations needed in interpolation.

   5.1: Obtain the source for the geos framework from
      http://trac.osgeo.org/geos

   5.2: Decompress the installation. 

   	  bunzip2 geos-3.3.2.tar.bz2
	  tar -xvf geos-3.3.2.tar

   5.3: Configure the installtion, using the --prefix flag to specifiy
      the base directory.

      	  cd geos-3.3.2
	  ./configure --prefix=/path/to/base/directory

   5.4: Build geos

   	  make

   5.5: Install geos to the base directory

   	  make install

   5.6: If the library directory under your base directory is not in a
      default location (IE /usr/local/lib) where the shell
      automatically looks, you need to add it to the library path.
      These lines should probably be added to your .tcshrc or .bashrc
      or .cshrc file (depending on your shell) as whips won't work
      properly if they are not.

      	  setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /path/to/base/directory/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

6) Install pyhdf 

   This is, to the best of my knowledge, the only python library that
   can read HDF4 files (like MOPITT).  It should theoretically be
   installable using the same technique as other python modules, but
   seems to be more finicky.

   6.1: Download the source for pyhdf from
      http://sourceforge.net/projects/pysclint

   6.2: Untar the source 

   	 tar -xzvf pyhdf-0.8.3.tar.gz

   6.3: Set environment variables so that the pyhdf installation will
      know where to find the hdf, zlib, and jpeg libraries.  Note that
      if these are in different libraries, you'll need to set the
      variables to point to multiple directories.  Note that because
      these are only needed for the install they won't need to go in
      the shrc file for your shell.

         setenv INCLUDE_DIRS /path/to/base/directory
	 setenv LIBRARY_DIRS /path/to/base/directory
	 setenv NOSZIP 1

   6.4: Go into the pyhdf folder and invoke the python setup script
      (which will both compile and install the script)

      	 cd pyhdf-0.8.3
	 python setup.py install

      If you run into problems, make sure that you properly set the
      -fPIC flag when compiling HDF4 (see step 2.7)

7) Install easy_install

   easy_install is a widely implemented framework for the installation
   of python modules.  It performs many of the features of a
   traditional package manager like yum or rpm, but most critically
   does NOT uninstall packages and does NOT chase down dependencies.
   We're going to use it extensively from here on out to install the
   python modules needed by whips

   7.1: Obtain the "egg" (distributed package) of easy_install from
      the maintainers at

         http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools#downloads
      
      Make sure to select the egg that matches your installation of
      python.

   7.2: Run the egg as a shell script and easy_install should install
      itself under the binary directory associated with your python
      installation.

	 sh setuptools-0.6c11-py2.7.egg

8) Install netCDF4-python

   This particular python module requires a different installation 
   approach than the others listed below, so we take care of it 
   first.  It's used for writing results to the popular netCDF
   file type.

   8.1: Download the source code for netcdf4-python from 
      code.google.com/p/netcdf4-python/downloads/list

   8.2: Unpack the source distribution

         tar -xzvf netcdf4-0.9.9.tar.gz

   8.3: If you haven't done so already, set HDF5_DIR 
      environmental variable to point to the base directory for
      the HDF5 install.  In addition, set NETCDF4_DIR to point
      to the base directory for the netCDF install.

         setenv HDF5_DIR /path/to/base/directory/
	 setenv NETCDF4_DIR /path/to/base/directory/

   8.4: Build the netCDF4-python library

   	 cd netCDF4-0.9.9
   	 python setup.py build

   8.5: Assuming the build didn't throw any errors, install 
      the library.

         python setup.py install

   8.6: If you want to, test the installation.  Note that in 
      some circumstances the library will work fine even if 
      the tests refuse to run entirely.

         cd test
	 python run_all.py

9) Install python modules available through easy_install

   These python modules are all used by whips to perform various
   operations.  They will be installed to whichever copy of python the
   operating system finds first, which makes it all the more important
   that you double check that this is the version you want (see step
   1.6)

   9.1: Install numpy, which is a basic array operation library.

   	 easy_install numpy

   9.2: Install shapely, a geometry library used by the interpolation
      routines in whips

      	 easy_install shapely

   9.3: Install pyproj, which is a port of the popular PROJ4 fortran
      library.  It provides the optimized projection functions used by
      whips.

	 easy_install PyProj

   9.4: Install numexpr, which is required for pytables

         easy_install numexpr

   9.5: Install cython, which is also required for pytables

   	 easy_install Cython

   9.6: Install pytables, a program allowing python read/write
      access to HDF5 files.

      9.6.1: Tell pytables where the HDF5 installation is.  Give it
         the base directory (as opposed to the library directory) via
         the environment variable HDF5_DIR.  This environment variable
         is only needed for the installation.

	      setenv HDF5_DIR /path/to/base/directory

      9.6.2: Install the actual pytables module itself (note that it
         isn't called pytables!)

	      easy_install tables

      9.6.3: Add the lib directory where you installed tables to your
         library path.  This should go in your .tcshrc or .bashrc or
         .cshrc file (depending on your shell) for whips to function
         properly

	      setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /path/to/base/directory/lib:$LD_LIBRARY-PATH

10) Install whips 

   Like most of the other python modules described here, whips is
   available through easy_install. 

   10.1: Install whips using the easy_install command

         easy_install whips

   10.2: The whips.py executable will be installed in 

         /path/to/base/directory/bin/   

      so if that folder isn't on your path, you'll need to make 
      it accessible from the command line.  The easiest means is 
      probably to add it to the path in your remote config file 
      (.tcshrc or .bashrc or .cshrc or ...).  This can be 
      accomplished from .tcshrc by adding the following line.

      	 setenv PATH $PATH:/path/to/base/directory/bin/

      Note that the first time you do this, you'll need to run
      
         source ~/.tcshrc 

      for it to take effect.
